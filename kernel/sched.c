sleep() always needs to hold a lock (lk). inside sleep(), once the calling

released

ONLY USE sched_lock to serialize task A/B is not enough wakeup() does NOT
need to hold lk. if that's the case, it's possible: task B: sleep(on chan) in
a loop; after it wakes up (no schedlock; only lk), before it calls sleep()
again, task A calls wakeup(chan), taking schelock and wakes up no task -->
wakeup is lost So our kernel cannot help on this case

to avoid the above, task A calling wakeup() must hold lk beforehand. b/c of
this, only after task B inside sleep() rls lk, task A can proceed to
wakeup(). inside wakeup(), task A is further serialized on schedlock, which
must wait until that task B has completely changed its p->state and is moved
